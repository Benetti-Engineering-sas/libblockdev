# List of tests to be skipped
#
# Example:
# This will skip the 'test_mount_ntfs' test case on Debian 10
# and on all 32bit machines
#
###################################
# - test: fs_test.MountTest.test_mount_ntfs
#   skip_on:
#     - distro: "debian"
#       version: "10"
#       reason: "NTFS mounting is broken on Debian testing"
#
#     - arch: "i686"
#       reason: "testing skipping from config file"
###################################
#
# Notes:
# - multiple combinations of reasons are supported.
# - 'reason' and at least one of 'distro', 'version' and 'arch' is required
# - 'test' (ID of the test case) can be specified as a regular expression
#   for example 'kbd_test.KbdBcacheTestCase.*' to skip all kbd tests
# - all "skips" can specified as a list, for example 'version: [10, 11]'
